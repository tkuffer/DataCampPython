###Examining traffic violations
##Before comparing the violations being committed by each gender, you should examine the violations committed by all drivers to get a baseline understanding of the data.

# Count the unique values in 'violation'
print(ri.violation.value_counts())

# Express the counts as proportions
print(ri.violation.value_counts(normalize=True))

###Comparing violations by gender
##The question we're trying to answer is whether male and female drivers tend to commit different types of traffic violations.

# Create a DataFrame of female drivers
female = ri[ri.driver_gender=='F']

# Create a DataFrame of male drivers
male = ri[ri.driver_gender=='M']

# Compute the violations by female drivers (as proportions)
print(female.violation.value_counts(normalize=True))

# Compute the violations by male drivers (as proportions)
print(male.violation.value_counts(normalize=True))

###Comparing speeding outcomes by gender
##When a driver is pulled over for speeding, many people believe that gender has an impact on whether the driver will receive a ticket or a warning. Can you find evidence of this in the dataset?
##First, you'll create two DataFrames of drivers who were stopped for speeding: one containing females and the other containing males.
##Then, for each gender, you'll use the stop_outcome column to calculate what percentage of stops resulted in a "Citation" (meaning a ticket) versus a "Warning"

# Create a DataFrame of female drivers stopped for speeding
female_and_speeding = ri[(ri.driver_gender=='F')&(ri.violation=='Speeding')]

# Create a DataFrame of male drivers stopped for speeding
male_and_speeding = ri[(ri.driver_gender=='M')&(ri.violation=='Speeding')]

# Compute the stop outcomes for female drivers (as proportions)
print(female_and_speeding.stop_outcome.value_counts(normalize=True))

# Compute the stop outcomes for male drivers (as proportions)
print(male_and_speeding.stop_outcome.value_counts(normalize=True))

###Calculating the search rate
##During a traffic stop, the police officer sometimes conducts a search of the vehicle. In this exercise, you'll calculate the percentage of all stops in the ri DataFrame that result in a vehicle search, also known as the search rate.

# Check the data type of 'search_conducted'
print(ri.search_conducted.dtype)

# Calculate the search rate by counting the values
print(ri.search_conducted.value_counts(normalize=True))

# Calculate the search rate by taking the mean
print(ri.search_conducted.mean())

###Comparing search rates by gender
##In this exercise, you'll compare the rates at which female and male drivers are searched during a traffic stop. Remember that the vehicle search rate across all stops is about 3.8%.

# Calculate the search rate for female drivers
print(ri[ri.driver_gender=='F'].search_conducted.mean())

# Calculate the search rate for male drivers
print(ri[ri.driver_gender=='M'].search_conducted.mean())

# Calculate the search rate for both groups simultaneously
print(ri.groupby('driver_gender').search_conducted.mean())

###Adding a second factor to the analysis
##Even though the search rate for males is much higher than for females, it's possible that the difference is mostly due to a second factor.
##For example, you might hypothesize that the search rate varies by violation type, and the difference in search rate between males and females is because they tend to commit different violations.
##You can test this hypothesis by examining the search rate for each combination of gender and violation. If the hypothesis was true, you would find that males and females are searched at about the same rate for each violation. Find out below if that's the case!

# Calculate the search rate for each combination of gender and violation
print(ri.groupby(['driver_gender', 'violation']).search_conducted.mean())

#Reverse the ordering to group by violation before gender
print(ri.groupby(['violation', 'driver_gender']).search_conducted.mean())

###Counting protective frisks
##During a vehicle search, the police officer may pat down the driver to check if they have a weapon. This is known as a "protective frisk."
# Count the 'search_type' values
print(ri.search_type.value_counts())

# Check if 'search_type' contains the string 'Protective Frisk'
ri['frisk'] = ri.search_type.str.contains('Protective Frisk', na=False)

# Check the data type of 'frisk'
print(ri.frisk.dtype)

# Take the sum of 'frisk'
print(ri.frisk.sum())

###Comparing frisk rates by gender
# Create a DataFrame of stops in which a search was conducted
searched = ri[ri.search_conducted]

# Calculate the overall frisk rate by taking the mean of 'frisk'
print(searched.frisk.mean())

# Calculate the frisk rate for each gender
print(searched.groupby('driver_gender').frisk.mean())
