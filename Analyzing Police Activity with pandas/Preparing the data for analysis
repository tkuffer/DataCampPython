###Examining the dataset

# Import the pandas library as pd
import pandas as pd

# Read 'police.csv' into a DataFrame named ri
ri = pd.read_csv('police.csv')

# Examine the head of the DataFrame
print(ri.head())

# Count the number of missing values in each column
print(ri.isnull().sum())

###Dropping columns
##Often, a DataFrame will contain columns that are not useful to your analysis. Such columns should be dropped from the DataFrame, to make it easier for you to focus on the remaining columns.

# Examine the shape of the DataFrame
print(ri.shape)

# Drop the 'county_name' and 'state' columns
ri.drop(['county_name', 'state'], axis='columns', inplace=True)

# Examine the shape of the DataFrame (again)
print(ri.shape)

###Dropping rows
##When you know that a specific column will be critical to your analysis, and only a small fraction of rows are missing a value in that column, it often makes sense to remove those rows from the dataset.

# Count the number of missing values in each column
print(ri.isnull().sum())

# Drop all rows that are missing 'driver_gender'
ri.dropna(subset=['driver_gender'], inplace=True)

# Count the number of missing values in each column (again)
print(ri.isnull().sum())

# Examine the shape of the DataFrame
print(ri.shape)

###Fixing a data type
##We saw in the previous exercise that the is_arrested column currently has the object data type. In this exercise, we'll change the data type to bool, which is the most suitable type for a column containing True and False values.
##Fixing the data type will enable us to use mathematical operations on the is_arrested column that would not be possible otherwise

# Examine the head of the 'is_arrested' column
print(ri.is_arrested.head())

# Change the data type of 'is_arrested' to 'bool'
ri['is_arrested'] = ri.is_arrested.astype('bool')

# Check the data type of 'is_arrested' 
print(ri.is_arrested.dtype)

###Combining object columns
##Currently, the date and time of each traffic stop are stored in separate object columns: stop_date and stop_time.

# Concatenate 'stop_date' and 'stop_time' (separated by a space)
combined = ri.stop_date.str.cat(ri.stop_time, sep= ' ')

# Convert 'combined' to datetime format
ri['stop_datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(combined)

# Examine the data types of the DataFrame
print(ri.dtypes)

###Setting the index
##The last step that you'll take in this chapter is to set the stop_datetime column as the DataFrame's index. By replacing the default index with a DatetimeIndex, you'll make it easier to analyze the dataset by date and time, which will come in handy later in the course!

# Set 'stop_datetime' as the index
ri.set_index('stop_datetime', inplace=True)

# Examine the index
print(ri.index)

# Examine the columns
print(ri.columns)
