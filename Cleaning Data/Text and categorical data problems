###Finding consistency
#In this exercise and throughout this chapter, you'll be working with the airlines DataFrame which contains survey responses on the San Francisco Airport from airline customers.
#The DataFrame contains flight metadata such as the airline, the destination, waiting times as well as answers to key questions regarding cleanliness, safety, and satisfaction. Another DataFrame named categories was created, containing all correct possible values for the survey columns.

# Print categories DataFrame
print(categories)

# Print unique values of survey columns in airlines
print('Cleanliness: ', airlines['cleanliness'].unique(), "\n")
print('Safety: ', airlines['safety'].unique(), "\n")
print('Satisfaction: ', airlines['satisfaction'].unique(), "\n")


###Finding consistency
#In this exercise and throughout this chapter, you'll be working with the airlines DataFrame which contains survey responses on the San Francisco Airport from airline customers.
#The DataFrame contains flight metadata such as the airline, the destination, waiting times as well as answers to key questions regarding cleanliness, safety, and satisfaction. Another DataFrame named categories was created, containing all correct possible values for the survey columns. 

# Find the cleanliness category in airlines not in categories
cat_clean = set(airlines['cleanliness']).difference(categories['cleanliness'])

# Find rows with that category
cat_clean_rows = airlines['cleanliness'].isin(cat_clean)

# Print rows with inconsistent category
print(airlines[cat_clean_rows])

# Print rows with consistent categories only
print(airlines[~cat_clean_rows])


###Inconsistent categories
#In this exercise, you'll be revisiting the airlines DataFrame from the previous lesson.
#As a reminder, the DataFrame contains flight metadata such as the airline, the destination, waiting times as well as answers to key questions regarding cleanliness, safety, and satisfaction on the San Francisco Airport.

# Print unique values of both columns
print(airlines['dest_region'].unique())
print(airlines['dest_size'].unique())

# Lower dest_region column and then replace "eur" with "europe"
airlines['dest_region'] = airlines['dest_region'].str.lower() 
airlines['dest_region'] = airlines['dest_region'].replace({'eur':'europe'})

# Remove white spaces from `dest_size`
airlines['dest_size'] = airlines['dest_size'].str.strip()

# Verify changes have been effected
print(airlines['dest_size'].unique())
print(airlines['dest_region'].unique())

###Remapping categories
#To better understand survey respondents from airlines, you want to find out if there is a relationship between certain responses and the day of the week and wait time at the gate.
#The airlines DataFrame contains the day and wait_min columns, which are categorical and numerical respectively. The day column contains the exact day a flight took place, and wait_min contains the amount of minutes it took travelers to wait at the gate.

# Create ranges for categories
label_ranges = [0, 60, 180, np.inf]
label_names = ['short', 'medium', 'long']

# Create wait_type column
airlines['wait_type'] = pd.cut(airlines['wait_min'], bins = label_ranges, 
                                labels = label_names)

# Create mappings and replace
mappings = {'Monday':'weekday', 'Tuesday':'weekday', 'Wednesday': 'weekday', 
            'Thursday': 'weekday', 'Friday': 'weekday', 
            'Saturday': 'weekend', 'Sunday': 'weekend'}

airlines['day_week'] = airlines['day'].replace(mappings)


###Removing titles and taking names
#While collecting survey respondent metadata in the airlines DataFrame, the full name of respondents was saved in the full_name column. However upon closer inspection, you found that a lot of the different names are prefixed by honorifics such as "Dr.", "Mr.", "Ms." and "Miss".
#Your ultimate objective is to create two new columns named first_name and last_name, containing the first and last names of respondents respectively. Before doing so however, you need to remove honorifics.

# Replace "Dr." with empty string ""
airlines['full_name'] = airlines['full_name'].str.replace("Dr.","")

# Replace "Mr." with empty string ""
airlines['full_name'] = airlines['full_name'].str.replace("Mr.","")


# Replace "Miss" with empty string ""
airlines['full_name'] = airlines['full_name'].str.replace("Miss","")

# Replace "Ms." with empty string ""
airlines['full_name'] = airlines['full_name'].str.replace("Ms.","")

# Assert that full_name has no honorifics
assert airlines['full_name'].str.contains('Ms.|Mr.|Miss|Dr.').any() == False


###Keeping it descriptive
#To further understand travelers' experiences in the San Francisco Airport, the quality assurance department sent out a qualitative questionnaire to all travelers who gave the airport the worst score on all possible categories. The objective behind this questionnaire is to identify common patterns in what travelers are saying about the airport.
#Their response is stored in the survey_response column. Upon a closer look, you realized a few of the answers gave the shortest possible character amount without much substance. In this exercise, you will isolate the responses with a character count higher than 40 , and make sure your new DataFrame contains responses with 40 characters or more using an assert statement. 

# Store length of each row in survey_response column
resp_length = airlines['survey_response'].str.len()

# Find rows in airlines where resp_length > 40
airlines_survey = airlines[resp_length > 40]

# Assert minimum survey_response length is > 40
assert airlines_survey['survey_response'].str.len().min() > 40

# Print new survey_response column
print(airlines_survey['survey_response'])
