###Make a PMF
##The GSS dataset has been pre-loaded for you into a DataFrame called gss. You can explore it in the IPython Shell to get familiar with it.
##In this exercise, you'll focus on one variable in this dataset, 'year', which represents the year each respondent was interviewed.

# Compute the PMF for year
pmf_year = Pmf(gss.year, normalize=False)

# Print the result
print(pmf_year)

# Select the age column
age = gss['age']

# Make a PMF of age
pmf_age = Pmf(age)

# Plot the PMF
pmf_age.bar()

# Label the axes
plt.xlabel('Age')
plt.ylabel('PMF')
plt.show()

###Make a CDF
##In this exercise, you'll make a CDF and use it to determine the fraction of respondents in the GSS dataset who are OLDER than 30.
##The GSS dataset has been preloaded for you into a DataFrame called gss.

# Select the age column
age = gss['age']

# Compute the CDF of age
cdf_age = Cdf(age)

# Calculate the CDF of 30

print(cdf_age[30])

###Compute IQR
##Recall from the video that the interquartile range (IQR) is the difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles. It is a measure of variability that is robust in the presence of errors or extreme values.

# Calculate the 75th percentile 
percentile_75th = cdf_income.inverse(0.75)

# Calculate the 25th percentile
percentile_25th = cdf_income.inverse(0.25)

# Calculate the interquartile range
iqr = percentile_75th - percentile_25th

# Print the interquartile range
print(iqr)

###Plot a CDF
##The distribution of income in almost every country is long-tailed; that is, there are a small number of people with very high incomes.

# Select realinc
income = gss.realinc
 
# Make the CDF
cdf_income = Cdf(income)
 
# Plot it
cdf_income.plot()

# Label the axes
plt.xlabel('Income (1986 USD)')
plt.ylabel('CDF')
plt.show()

###Extract education levels
##Let's create Boolean Series to identify respondents with different levels of education.
##In the U.S, 12 years of education usually means the respondent has completed high school (secondary education). A respondent with 14 years of education has probably completed an associate degree (two years of college); someone with 16 years has probably completed a bachelor's degree (four years of college).

# Select educ
educ = gss['educ']
 
# Bachelor's degree
bach = (educ >= 16)
 
# Associate degree
assc = (educ >= 14) & (educ < 16)
 
# High school (12 or fewer years of education)
high = (educ <= 12)
print(high.mean())


###Plot income CDFs
##Let's now see what the distribution of income looks like for people with different education levels. You can do this by plotting the CDFs. Recall how Allen plotted the income CDFs of respondents interviewed before and after 1995:
income = gss['realinc']

# Plot the CDFs
Cdf(income[high]).plot(label='High school')
Cdf(income[assc]).plot(label='Associate')
Cdf(income[bach]).plot(label='Bachelor')

# Label the axes
plt.xlabel('Income (1986 USD)')
plt.ylabel('CDF')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

###Distribution of income
##In many datasets, the distribution of income is approximately lognormal, which means that the logarithms of the incomes fit a normal distribution. We'll see whether that's true for the GSS data. As a first step, you'll compute the mean and standard deviation of the log of incomes using NumPy's np.log10() function.

# Extract realinc and compute its log
income = gss['realinc']
log_income = np.log10(income)
 
# Compute mean and standard deviation
mean = np.mean(log_income)
std = np.std(log_income)
print(mean, std)
 
# Make a norm object
from scipy.stats import norm
dist = norm(mean,std)

###Comparing CDFs
##To see whether the distribution of income is well modeled by a lognormal distribution, we'll compare the CDF of the logarithm of the data to a normal distribution with the same mean and standard deviation. These variables from the previous exercise are available for use:

# Extract realinc and compute its log
log_income = np.log10(gss['realinc'])

# Compute mean and standard deviation
mean, std = log_income.mean(), log_income.std()

# Make a norm object
from scipy.stats import norm
dist = norm(mean, std)

dist is a scipy.stats.norm object with the same mean and standard deviation as the data. It provides .cdf(), which evaluates the normal cumulative distribution function.


# Evaluate the model CDF
xs = np.linspace(2, 5.5)
ys = dist.cdf(xs)
 
# Plot the model CDF
plt.clf()
plt.plot(xs, ys, color='gray')
 
# Create and plot the Cdf of log_income
Cdf(log_income).plot()
     
# Label the axes
plt.xlabel('log10 of realinc')
plt.ylabel('CDF')
plt.show()

###Comparing PDFs
##In the previous exercise, we used CDFs to see if the distribution of income is lognormal. We can make the same comparison using a PDF and KDE. That's what you'll do in this exercise!
##As before, the norm object dist is available in your workspace:

from scipy.stats import norm
dist = norm(mean, std)

Just as all norm objects have a .cdf() method, they also have a .pdf() method.

# Evaluate the normal PDF
xs = np.linspace(2, 5.5)
ys = dist.pdf(xs)
 
# Plot the model PDF
plt.clf()
plt.plot(xs, ys, color='gray')
 
# Plot the data KDE
sns.kdeplot(log_income)
 
# Label the axes
plt.xlabel('log10 of realinc')
plt.ylabel('PDF')
plt.show()
