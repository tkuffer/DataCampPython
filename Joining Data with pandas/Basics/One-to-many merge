One-to-many merge

A business may have one or multiple owners. In this exercise, you will continue to gain experience with one-to-many merges by merging a table of business owners, called biz_owners, to the licenses table. Recall from the video lesson, with a one-to-many relationship, a row in the left table may be repeated if it is related to multiple rows in the right table. In this lesson, you will explore this further by finding out what is the most common business owner title. (i.e., secretary, CEO, or vice president)

The licenses and biz_owners DataFrames are loaded for you.

# Merge the licenses and biz_owners table on account
licenses_owners = licenses.merge(biz_owners, on='account')

# Group the results by title then count the number of accounts
counted_df = licenses_owners.groupby('title').agg({'account':'count'})

# Sort the counted_df in desending order
sorted_df = counted_df.sort_values(by='account', ascending=False)

# Use .head() method to print the first few rows of sorted_df
print(sorted_df.head())
